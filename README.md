# Make Better Coffee ‚òïÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Make Better Coffee** app! This application allows coffee lovers to input their brewing parameters (coffee dose, water temperature, volume, number of pours, and brew time) to determine if their coffee will be **strong**, **balanced**, or **weak** based on these factors by predicting the total dissolved solids (TDS). Whether you're a coffee enthusiast or a beginner, this app will guide you in making the perfect cup.
